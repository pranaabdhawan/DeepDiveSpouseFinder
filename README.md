# DeepDiveSpouseFinder
The project uses DeepDive to extract mentions of spouses from the news. The project uses Distant Supervision to create a training set for the model. 
Under the hood, Deep Dive specifies a factor graph where the features are unary factors, and then uses SGD and Gibbs sampling for learning and inference.
The results and accuracy ratios would be posted soon.
